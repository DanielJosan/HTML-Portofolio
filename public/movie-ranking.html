<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>James Bond</h3>
<p>Quite frankly all the movies in the series played by Daniel Craig.</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>The action is amazing and Keeanu Reaves is one of the coolest people to ever walk the face of Earth.</p>

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<p>A lot of funny moments combined with some very interesting plot twists.</p>
